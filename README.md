- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcelo Esparza Fullstak Javascript Engineer (React.js super fan!). Github account: @mesparza942

- 🌱 I’m currently working at Truelogic Software as a FullStack Software Engineer (Node.js + React.js + GraphQL)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to the dev community as much as possible. I'm working on some personal Custom React Components which
      you will find on my github repos, generally with the prefix `react-<custom_component>`.

- 📫 If you are interested to contribute to one of my custom React components, create an issue or create a pull request 
      detailing what changes you would like to do and I will review it as soon as possible.
