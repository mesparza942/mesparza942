- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcelo Esparza Fullstak Javascript Engineer. Github account: @mesparza942

- 🌱 I’m currently working for an Ecuadorian company named Dreamcode. I'm the 
      Head of Education of Dreamcode Academy and I also support some of Dreamcode's 
      projects as a Fullstack Javascript Engineer. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to the dev community as much as possible. Dreamcode Academy
      gives me the opportunity to share my knowledge with Junior Developers that are seeking
      to obtain their next dream job. I'm also working on some Custom React Components which
      you will find on my github repos, generally with the prefix `react-<custom_component>`.

- 📫 If you are interested to be part of Dreamcode's Academy bootcamp or just want to specialize
      purchasing one of our courses please reach out to my e-mail: marcelo@dreamcode.io
      Or if you just want to contribute to one of my custom react components, create an issue or
      create a pull request detailing what changes you would like to do.
